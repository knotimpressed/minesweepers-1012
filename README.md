Spot the Mines  
A range of numbers varying from 1-25 to 1-100 are scrambled on a grid, each number representing a mine. The number of mines can be selected with a difficulty setting, which will also impact the amount of time the user has to complete the game. The game is completed when the user clicks on every mine, in order, before the timer ends. If the user clicks on an incorrect mine or runs out of time, the game is terminated and is lost. The project will also include a basic leaderboard with the userâ€™s best attempts so far.  

Requirement Definitions:  
* The program on start shows the user a start menu with the leaderboard, start, and difficulty
* The user can select a difficulty level by clicking a button which impacts the number of mines and time
* The game can be started by clicking the start button on the main menu
* The game ends when an incorrect mine is clicked on  
* The game ends when there is no time left  
* The mines are scrambled well and all visible within the grid defined by the difficulty
* Clicked on mines change in appearance  
* Top scores are visible in a leaderboard in the main menu
* After playing a game users can submit their score with a name they input, which will be displayed on the leaderboard
* The user can play as many games as they want by going back to the start menu through clicking a back button
