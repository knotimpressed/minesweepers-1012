  Todo:
  popups, leaderboard/server side stuff

  not on wireframe: counter for which mine youre on

  Current Bugs/Fixes needed:
    1. Was making sure any possible senario the timer worked, and sadly it didn't. When Failing an attempt by clicking the wrong mine it
    ends the game, then goes to the home screen, then restarts the timer from the left over time in the attempt while in the home screen @Knot
    Notes: Im thinking the buttons should turn some very dim but "positive" colour when clicked
    (cont): maybe move all the get elementbyid to jquery?+

    2. back button from game to home

    3. (just for luke) get github to recogize my commits with my github account

  Questions:
  None

  Extra stuff: change the new game button colour and shadow based on difficulty colour

  NEEDED:

  game over to be less scuffed (proper popup)
  popups in general for leaderboard and others

  Server side ideas:
  copy code from minesweeper, instead of passing code back pass back array of mines, move mine randomization to server side and leave the rest here for now

  then for the leaderboard, we can pass back an array of the top 5 scores, and just compare every submitted score either 
  at the client side to the known values or more likely server side since we would have to anyways to know where it went in.

  extra stuff:
  enter inputs leaderboard
  timer actual minutes
  leaderboard times not mines
