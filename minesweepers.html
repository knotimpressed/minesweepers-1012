  Todo: timer based on difficulty,
  popups, leaderboard, server side stuff

  not on wireframe: counter for which mine youre on

  Current Bugs/Fixes needed:
    1. The mine sequence is kept from one game to the next, meaning if i lose on mine #9 i can restart from 9 again.ie reset mine sequence after each game.
    2. Need to add an end with gameover() when the timer reaches 0 (or -1 cause time delay)
    Notes: Im thinking the buttons should turn some very dim but "positive" colour when clicked

  Questions:
  Do we need the "New Game" button? the "Home" one works pretty well I'd say, plus new game doesnt let you change the difficulty
    @Knot I think it is fine to keep because it's like a re-scramble mechanic, so like if I can't fine one and I just want to try again it's faster'
  Extra stuff: change the new game button colour and shadow based on difficulty colour
